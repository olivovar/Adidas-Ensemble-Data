**Author:** Olivia Pivovar  
**Project:** Analysis of Adidas' social media engagement on TikTok and Instagram using data collected via the Ensemble API.

This repository contains Python scripts, visualizations, and cleaned datasets used to examine trends in social media performance across TikTok and Instagram.

---

## Features

- Parses raw TikTok and Instagram data using the Ensemble API format
- Cleans, structures, and extracts post-level metrics
- Computes engagement rates and analyzes patterns (hour, emoji usage, caption length, etc.)
- Generates comparative visualizations across platforms
- Exports clean datasets to CSV for further analysis
